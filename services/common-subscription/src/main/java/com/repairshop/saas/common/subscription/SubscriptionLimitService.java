/**
 * The reusable subscription entitlement engine — the backend's final authority
 * on every plan allowance and every on/off feature.
 *
 * <p>What this class owns is the <em>policy</em>: which plan applies, whether it
 * is in date, what each allowance is, how usage is counted, and how a refusal is
 * worded. Adding a new metered feature means adding a constant to
 * {@link SubscriptionFeature}, a usage query here, and one call to
 * {@link #requireCapacity} at the create site — not a new copy of this logic.
 *
 * <p>Usage counting lives here rather than in each caller because <em>what
 * counts</em> is policy too: only active employees consume a seat, only shops
 * that are not soft-deleted consume the shop allowance. Several services
 * enforce the same limits, and a count written twice is a count that can be
 * written differently twice.
 *
 * <h2>Fail-open cases</h2>
 * Three situations allow the action through rather than blocking it:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>No subscription row.</b> Owners created before the subscription
 *       feature shipped have no row. Blocking them would break working shops
 *       for a data-migration reason, so they are allowed and logged. Run the
 *       migration-92 backfill to bring them under a plan.</li>
 *   <li><b>Unresolvable plan code.</b> A typo in one row should not lock an
 *       owner out of their own staff list.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@code ggfix.subscription.enforcement.enabled=false}.</b> A kill
 *       switch, so a mis-scoped limit can be disabled from config rather than
 *       needing a rebuild and redeploy of every affected service.</li>
 * </ul>
